## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experiment

1. Download data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B9WRpkfHn48VfkaHjnErgQ5yb8Vv6PSj?usp=drive_link) and put into /data/NYC or /data/DC.


2. We provide the experiment scripts of all models under the folder ./scripts. You can reproduce the experiment results by:
   ```
   ./scripts/Main/NYC/NODA.sh
   ./scripts/Main/DC/NODA.sh
   ./scripts/Ablation/Transformer.sh
   ./scripts/Ablation/Attention.sh
   ```
